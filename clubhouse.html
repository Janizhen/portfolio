            <div>
                    <p>Clubhouse is is a <span class="highlight-1">social network app</span> based on <span class="highlight-1">voice</span>, where people can create and join "rooms" and chat with others. Clubhouse is a good place to meet new friends with shared interests.
                    </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Despite its initial success, the popularity of Clubhouse did not last long (according to Sensor Tower, the app's downloads decreased by 90% within a few months in 2021). Users have also been expressing their dissatisfaction online, as they can no longer find ideal content on the app. This case study aims to analyze the reasons behind this problem and suggest potential solutions.</p>
        </div>
<!--research-->
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <div>
                <p>I did some research through online platforms, app reviews, comments, blogs, articles and also talked to people I know. From the research, I summarized the main issues that people were bringing up.</p>
                <h4>Main problems:</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="research-flex">
                <div>

                    <br> "... hard to find a room with right topic where I might join and talk."

                        "The conversations have no time limit, it may last too long."
                        <br>"Low voice quality due to the speaker's bad wifi and microfon."
                        <br>...

                <p>
                    This case study will focus on the first two problems, which can be restated as a single question: How can users easily find rooms with the valuable information they prefer?
                </p>
        </div>
<!--analysis-->
<!--summary-->
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <div>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, I first looked deeper into users' needs through personas and with the understanding of users' mindset, then I went through the existing Clubhouse interface and identified the blockages along the existing user flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4 class="analysis-p">Personas</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personas should represent the main user groups of the app. But who are the user groups in this case? Under which situations do people need to use this app and talk online? I summarized three main situations where users have the need of having conversations on an app. 
                </p>
        </div>
<!--flexbox for user groups-->
        <div class="analysis-flex">
            <div>
                Connecting with <span class="highlight-3">family and friends</span>
                <p>
                    As there are already strong competitors such as <strong>facebook, what's app</strong> who provide same functions(online voice conversation) and already have a network based on family and friends, then why bother downloading another app?
                </p>
                <p>
                Therefore, in this case study, this group is <strong>NOT</strong> considered as the target group for the app.&#x1F615
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                Discussing with people who have <span class="highlight-3">shared interests</span>
                        <p>
                            Clubhouse is based on houses, which are dedicated to different interests, hobbies and topics. It is a better choice to position Clubhouse as <strong>"a place where you can meet people with shared interests from all over the world".</strong> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This group will be a main target group for Clubhouse. &#x1F603

                        <p>
                            When I was doing the research, I noticed a large portion of users do not have a specific idea of what topic they want to discuss. <strong>They simply want to find somebody who are available to talk. </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                Existing user flow
            </h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            With the users(personas)’ goal in mind, I analysed the existing user flow and see whether Clubhouse can fulfil users’ needs and where the problems are: 
        </div>
        <div class="userflow-img-container">
            <img src="case-clubhouse/userflow.png">
        </div>
<!--user journey flex-->
        <div>
            After the analysis, I discovered the <strong>product positioning</strong> of Clubhouse is unclear. Product positioning communicates the unique value of a product to the target customers in a way that differentiates it from other products in the market. The app mixed up the concept of "socializing with close friends" and the concept of "getting to know new people". 
            <br>
            <br>Although users may still get to know new people through the contacts, but the problem is, they can only incrementally expand their social circle. However, if the app's mechanism is not based on contacts, but all people of the same shared interests are available to you, you have much greater chance to find the right room and the right people you want!
            <br>
            <br>I summarized the problems and a potential solution as follows:
        </div>
        <div class="userflow-flex-1">
            <p>
                <strong>Clubhouse must make it clear:</strong>

                (The mechanism of these two ways below are completely different.)
            </p>
            <div class="userflow-flex-2">
                <div class="column-left">
                    <div class="column-card">
                        <p>
                            Is Clubhouse positioned as an app based on <strong>close friends and family</strong> (Clubhouse’s current mechanism), 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="column-text">
                        Current problem:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If users want to discuss a specific topic, within the limited contact-based circle, users may probably <strong>not find anyone happens to be online and also wants to talk about the same topic</strong>. And users will get a lot of random rooms on the homepage.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This leads to users’ feedback in the research:
                       <br> "... impossible to scroll through all of the recommendations to find topic I have interest."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, social media like Facebook and what’s app also have this voice-based function, they are actually more convenient choices for users to connect with friends and family. (It is also discussed in the user group section above.)
                    </p>

                            Is it positioned as an app for people to meet strangers <strong>with shared interests all over the globe</strong>? And meet the people you probably would never come across in you daily life?
                        </p>

                    <p class="column-text">
                        Solution:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Change the mechanism from <strong>contact-based</strong> to <strong>category-based</strong>.

                        <br>
                        Which means, <strong>all ongoing rooms</strong> under a specific topic category <strong>could be seen</strong> on the recommended page, no matter whether the speakers have relationship with users’ contacts or not.
