                I've always had a passion for art and design and have a Bachelor's degree in Architecture. during my study, I began to explore various design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, layout techniques, color theory, and 3D modeling.

                After completing my Master's degree in International Business, I began working in the sales department of an IT company. At some point, I discovered web design and became intrigued by it. I think this is the path I should really pursue. Since last November (2022), I have been learning User experience and user interdace design (UX/UI), Html and CSS, and a little javascript. The idea of combining it with coding is truly exciting to me. I am actively exploring this field and eager to see where this journey takes me.
